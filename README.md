# Powerful Heroes

## Description
Ever felt like your companions are worse compared to your higher tier troops? Does it
feel underwhelming when defeating enemy king in a one swing? This mod aims to fix that!

Powerful Heroes is a mod that makes all heroes (player, champions, nobles...)
more powerfull while in battle.

# Features
- Hero/Horse Damage Recieved Multiplier -- This value is used to calculate the damage every hero or their horse recieves receives, very similar to native difficulty settings.
- Hero/Horse HitPoints Multiplier -- Changes hitpoints in battle. Does not affect campaign. Usefull when you want to hero/horse survive longer, but still be staggered/reared.
